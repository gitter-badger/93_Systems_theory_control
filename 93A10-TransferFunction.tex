The \emph{transfer function} of a linear dynamical system is the ratio of the Laplace transform of its output to the Laplace transform of its input.  In systems theory, the Laplace transform is called the ``frequency domain'' representation of the system.

Consider a canonical dynamical system
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \dot x(t) &=& A x(t) + B u(t) \\
    y (t) &=& C x(t) + D u(t)
\end{eqnarray*}
with input $u: R \mapsto R^n$, output $y: R \mapsto R^m$ and state $x:R \mapsto R^p$, and $(A,B,C,D)$ are constant matrices of conformable sizes.

The frequency domain representation is
$$
    y(s) = (D + C(sI - A)^{-1}B)u(s),
$$
and thus the transfer function matrix is $D + C(sI - A)^{-1}B$.

In the case of single-input-single-output systems ($m=n=1$), the transfer function is commonly expressed as a rational function of $s$:
$$
    H(s) = \frac{\prod_{i=0}^Z (s - z_i)}{\prod_{i=0}^P (s - p_i)}.
$$
The values $z_i$ are called the zeros of $H(s)$, and the values $p_i$ are called the poles.  If any of the poles has positive real part, then the transfer function is termed \emph{unstable}; if all of the poles have strictly negative real part, it is \emph{stable}.
