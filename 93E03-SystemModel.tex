\begin{document}
Let $t = 1, 2,\ldots$ denote discrete time instants. By a {\it system model} we mean a mathematical model defined by a conditional probability density function $f(y_{t}|u_{t}, d(t-1))$ where
\begin{description}
  \item [$y_{t}$] is the system output in time $t$,
  \item [$u_{t}$] is the system input and 
  \item [$d(t-1)$] denotes the sequence of data $d_{0}, \ldots, d_{t-1}$ where $d_{t} = (u_{t}, y_{t})$.
\end{description}
Such a system has time-invariant (constant) parameters. 
If the model parameters are unknown (uncertain, variable), we introduce the definition in the form $f(y_{t}|u_{t}, d(t-1), \theta)$. Here, $\theta$ is a (possibly multi-dimensional) parameter.
